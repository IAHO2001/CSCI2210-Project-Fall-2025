Items worked on for Stage 3: 

-Updated and finalized the UML Diagram for Stage 3 using Lucidchart and a diagram generator based on our codes, working closely with teammates to make sure all classes, associations, and updates from this stage were reflected accurately.

-Created and revised the source code for the Admin, Restaurant, Customer/User, and LoginManager classes. This included implementing constructors, methods, validation, menus, and interactions so each class functioned correctly within the system.

-Assisted teammates by reviewing sections of their code to ensure consistency, correct formatting, and proper integration with the overall design of the food delivery system.

-Communicated frequently through group messages to share updates, and confirme that every required file for Stage 3 was uploaded to GitHub on time.

-Collaborated with the team to ensure the code merged smoothly and that the UML Diagram matched the final version of all implemented classes.

-Helped ensure the project followed the Stage 3 requirements by double-checking structure, class relationships, and method functionality across the system.

-Lastly, I created this txt file with all the listed responsibilities of my person and how I contributed to this stage.
