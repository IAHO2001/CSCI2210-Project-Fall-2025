This UML diagram represents a food delivery system program. The diagram illustrates the interactions between the various classes of the system. Each box is a class with its own unique attributes and relationships with each of the other class boxes. The arrows in the diagram that point to other boxes and are labeled show how the classes connect, such as the class containing, managing, or placing. For instance, the class Admin manages the FoodDeliverySystem class, which includes users, restaurants, and orders. This can also be said for how the Customer class allows restaurant and menu browsing, along with the ability for the customer to add menu items to their cart. The diagram illustrates how the Order class is sent to the Restaurant class for meal preparation. During this, the DeliveryPerson class is assigned to deliver the order that the Restaurant class is preparing. Now the customer must pay through the Payment class to see a confirmation that their order has been processed. After the payment process and the order is delivered, the customer can write a Review/Rating about the Restaurant. All data, like orders, restaurants, reviews, ratings, and users, is maintained within the FoodDeliverysystem class.
